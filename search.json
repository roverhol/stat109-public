Emphasis: methods and applications used in the biological and natural resource sciences.\nDivision: Lower Division  Weekly: Lecture 3 hrs. Activity 2 hrs.  Instruction Mode: In-person\nPrerequisite: MATH 101 or MATH 101I or MATH 102 or MATH 109B (may be taken concurrently with instructor approval) with a grade of C- or better or ALEKS PPL assessment score over 65 or appropriate high school coursework. See Math Placement and ALEKS PPL for details. MATH 102 may be taken concurrently with instructor approval.\nNote: if you plan to use STAT 109 as a prerequisite for another MATH, DATA or STAT course, you must have a grade of C- or better in this course.\n\n\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to:\n\nUse numerical and graphical descriptive statistics to summarize and interpret data.\nExplain the role of randomness, probability, and sampling in statistical inference.\nApply probability rules and work with common probability distributions.\nConstruct and interpret confidence intervals for means and proportions.\nConduct and interpret basic hypothesis tests.\nAnalyze relationships between pairs of variables using correlation and regression.\nUse a statistical programming language to analyze data and communicate results.\nDistinguish between correlation and causation and recognize limitations of statistical conclusions.\n\n\n\n\nThis course fulfills Lower Division General Education Area 2 (Quantitative Reasoning) and supports Cal Poly Humboldt’s Institutional Learning Outcomes related to quantitative reasoning, critical thinking, and communication.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTAT 109 includes:\n\nThree weekly lecture meetings\nOne weekly laboratory session\n\nIn this 4-unit course, students should expect to spend approximately 12 hours per week on course-related work, including time in lecture (3 hours), lab time (2 hours), and time outside of class to do practice problems, projects and prepare for exams and quizzes (7 hours).\n\n\nLecture Notes: I’ll provide packets of guided notes to you in class. These notes have key concepts, definitions and word problems that we’ll solve during class time. These notes have spaces for you to fill in during lecture as we go. If you need to miss class, please ask me for the packet you will be missing.\nOptional Textbook: Introductory Statistics for the Life and Biomedical Sciences by Julie Vu and Dave Harrington, available for free online.\nThree Binder: Please bring a three-ring binder to class to keep the lecture note packets in.\nPen or Pencil: Please bring a pen or pencil to class to take notes with.\nSoftware: R (free and installed on all campus computers; see R download page to install on your own computer) \nCalculator: Scientific (not graphing) calculator \nOther Technology: Regular access to a computer with reliable internet\n\n\n\nStudents who do not have personal access to required technology may use campus computer labs and library resources. If you want to get a free used computer, please check to see if our campus’s Reuseable Office Supply Exchange (ROSE) has one available.\n\n\n\nThere are no additional course fees beyond standard tuition and registration fees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents will complete a variety of assessments:\n\nDaily warm-up problems (Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, in lecture)\nWeekly programming labs (due Tuesdays, in Canvas: I’ll help you write the code the Thursday before)\nWeekly quizzes based on practice problems and labs (Thursdays at the beginning of lab)\nTwo midterms (Week 6 and Week 13 Fridays, in lecture)\nFive projects (Sundays at the ends of the weeks 5, 8, 10, 12, and 15, in Canvas)\n\nDaily warm-up problems are designed to give you an opportunity to work as a team with your classmates. Weekly labs and quizzes are designed to provide regular formative feedback through practice problems, posted solutions, and in-lab support. Midterms require students to demonstrate their understanding of the course material. Projects allow students to apply their knowledge to practical, real-world problems and can be used as part of a portfolio.\nOptionally, students may take a final exam (held during the scheduled final exam period: Wednesday, May 13, 2026, 10:20–12:10 PM, BSS 166) to replace a midterm grade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nWeight\n\n\n\n\nDaily Participation\n5%\n\n\nWeekly quizzes\n30%\n\n\nWeekly labs\n15%\n\n\nTwo midterms\n30%\n\n\nFive projects\n20%\n\n\nTotal\n100%\n\n\n\nFinal letter grades will be assigned based on overall performance according to the following:\nA: 93-100% A-: 90-92% B+: 87-89% B: 83-86% B-: 80-82% C+: 77-79% C: 73-76% C-: 70-72% D: 60-69% F: 0-59%\nNote:\n\nGrade Mode: Letter grade by default. Students may elect Credit/No Credit grading according to university deadlines and procedures.\nA minimum grade of C- is required for the course to count toward GE Area B4.\nIf you stop attending class and stop doing assignments without communicating with me, you will receive a grade of WU (Withdrawal Unsatisfactory). Please communicate with me early if you are having difficulties: it’s possible that I can help you get back on track, or help you obtain a more appropriate grade (W or I) for your situation.\n\n\n\n\nRegular attendance and active participation are expected and essential for success in this course.\n\nAttendance in lecture will be tracked via participation in the warm-up problems.\nAttendance in lab will be tracked via participation in the quizzes.\n\nIf you must miss class, you are responsible for obtaining notes and keeping up with course material.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe policies for late or missed work are as follows:\n\nDaily attendance in lecture is required, but I know that sometimes you will need to miss class due to illness or other emergencies. Each student may miss up to 10 days of lecture without penalty and without contacting me. It’s up to you to reserve these days for emergencies only. In my experience, it is rare for a student to succeed if they regularly miss lecture or are absent for more than two weeks so if you find yourself in this situation, please communicate with me and your advisor so we can help you find a solution to getting back on track.\nWeekly quizzes during Thursday lab sessions are required, but I know that sometimes you will need to miss lab due to illness or other emergencies. If this happens, please contact me to make an arrangement to take the quiz at another time.\nWeekly programming labs are due Tuesdays in Canvas. After the due date, a solution will be posted, so late submissions are generally not accepted except in documented emergencies. These labs will be graded on completion and your reflection.\nProjects are due on the specified date in Canvas. You may submit a late project up to a week late with no penalty. After a week, a project can be turn in for 70% of the grade.\nMidterms are required. If you need to miss a midterm due to illness or other emergencies, please communicate with me as soon as possible to reschedule it. Alternatively, you may take the optional final exam (Wednesday, May 13, 2026, 10:20–12:10 PM, BSS 166) to replace a missed midterm grade.\n\nNote: Technology issues (internet access, device failure, software problems) are not automatically considered valid excuses for late or missed work; students are expected to plan accordingly.\n\n\n\nMuch of your course grade will be based on materials that you produce in-class without having AI as a resource. But you may use AI, such as NotebookLM or ChatGPT, in this course to help you learn the materials or to perform data analyses or on the projects.\nFor work that you do at home that is turned in for a grade I have two requirements:\n\nif you used AI, acknowledge this briefly in the document (you don’t need to state in detail how you used AI or give your prompts, just the name of the AI service you used).\n\nBe responsible for the correctness and appropriateness of all (AI assisted or not) materials you turn in.\n\nI may use AI to assist me in my delivery of the course material, such as asking AI to see if an assignment is appropriate for a college level course or if the wording of a quiz question could be improved. I will not use AI to grade your work or use an AI detection tool to check your work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to data, simulation, and statistical reasoning\nSelected topics in probability\nBinomial Random Process\nA simple hypothesis test\nNormal probability distribution\nSampling distributions and the Central Limit Theorem\nSampling methods\nConfidence intervals\nStudy design\nMore Hypothesis testing\nSimple predictive modeling via Linear regression\n\n\n\n\nNote: This schedule is subject to change.
