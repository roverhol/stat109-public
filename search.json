    "text": "These practice problems cover:\n\nLecture 12: Introduction to the binomial test (ESP example), hypotheses \\(H_0\\) vs \\(H_a\\), the 4 conditions of a Binomial Random Process (BRP), and the steps of the test.\nLecture 13: ESP worksheet — stating hypotheses, verifying BRP conditions, identifying \\(n\\) and \\(p\\), and finding the p-value.\nLecture 14: Binomial test steps and examples (left-handed, defective items, dice, gym use): research question, parameter, hypotheses, null distribution plot, adding the observed data and shading the p-value on the graph, and drawing conclusions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork without notes first; then check your answers against the solutions in Canvas.\nFor graph questions: The figures show the null distribution (bar plot of \\(x\\) vs \\(P(X=x)\\)) with no shading. On each figure, by hand: (1) draw a vertical line at the observed value of \\(x\\) given in the problem, and (2) shade the bar(s) that correspond to the p-value (in the direction of \\(H_a\\)).\nThe in-person quiz in lab will be created from these practice problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch question (in words): We want to test whether a person has Extra Sensory Perception (ESP) — the ability to predict outcomes better than chance. To do this, we use an online test: on each of 25 trials, the computer randomly shows one of 5 possible symbols (e.g. circle, cross, star), and the person guesses which symbol it is. If they do not have ESP, they are just guessing among 5 options on each trial. If they do have ESP, we expect them to get more than chance correct.\nLet \\(p\\) = probability of a correct prediction on a single trial (when the person makes one guess).\n\nWrite the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) and alternative hypothesis \\(H_a\\) in symbols.\nIn words, what does it mean if \\(H_0\\) is true? What are we claiming if we believe \\(H_a\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting: The same ESP test as in A1: 25 trials, 5 possible symbols per trial, the computer picks one symbol at random each time (“open deck”), and the person sees the card (or result) after each guess. We record the number of correct predictions out of 25.\nList the 4 conditions of a Binomial Random Process and briefly state why each is satisfied in this setting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting: The same ESP test as in Part A: 25 trials, 5 symbols, the person guesses on each trial. Under the null hypothesis, the person is just guessing (no ESP).\n\nWhat is \\(n\\)?\nWhat is \\(p\\) (the probability of a correct guess on one trial under \\(H_0\\))?\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting: Same ESP test: 25 trials, 5 symbols. Under the null, \\(p = 0.2\\) (just guessing). We test \\(H_0: p = 0.2\\) vs \\(H_a: p &gt; 0.2\\). Suppose you took the test and got 7 correct out of 25.\n\nWhat is the observed value of \\(x\\)?\nThe p-value is the probability, assuming \\(H_0\\) is true, of observing data as or more extreme than the observed \\(x\\) in the direction of \\(H_a\\). Write the p-value as a probability involving \\(X\\) (e.g. \\(P(X \\geq \\ldots)\\) or \\(P(X \\leq \\ldots)\\)).\nWould you need the right tail, the left tail, or both tails of the null distribution to compute this p-value?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach figure below shows the null distribution for a scenario (bar plot of \\(x\\) vs \\(P(X=x)\\)). The plots are unshaded. For each problem:\n\nOn the figure: Draw a vertical line at the observed value of \\(x\\) (given in the problem).\nOn the figure: Shade the bar(s) that represent the p-value (i.e. the region in the direction of \\(H_a\\): right tail for \\(H_a: p &gt; \\ldots\\), left tail for \\(H_a: p &lt; \\ldots\\), or both tails for \\(H_a: p \\neq \\ldots\\)).\nIn the blank: State whether the p-value is small or large and give the conclusion (reject \\(H_0\\) or fail to reject \\(H_0\\)) in context.\n\n\n\n\nResearch question: Is the proportion of left-handed students at our school higher than the national rate of 10%?\nParameter: \\(p\\) = proportion of students at our school who are left-handed.\nHypotheses: \\(H_0: p = 0.10\\) vs \\(H_a: p &gt; 0.10\\).

In context: __________.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch question: When we roll two dice, is the probability that the sum is 7 or 11 equal to the fair-dice value? (With fair dice, that probability is \\(8/36\\): 6 ways to get sum 7 plus 2 ways to get sum 11, out of 36 equally likely outcomes.)\nParameter: \\(p\\) = probability that a single roll of two dice gives a sum of 7 or 11.\nHypotheses: \\(H_0: p = 8/36\\) vs \\(H_a: p \\neq 8/36\\).
