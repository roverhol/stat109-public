    "text": "Extra Sensory Perception (ESP) is the ability to accurately predict what will happen using supernatural methods. Do I have it? If so, I could make lots of money by betting on the stock market! To find out, we can take an online ESP test and then analyze the data using the Binomial Test.\n\n\n\n\nWe will collect data from the Advanced ESP (Zener Cards) test at PsychicScience.org.\n\nThe test uses 5 possible symbols (circle, cross, waves, square, star).\nOn each trial, the computer randomly selects one symbol; your task is to guess it.\nWe will use 25 attempts (25 cards).\nChoose: Clairvoyance, Open deck, Cards seen, and 25 cards.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(p\\) be the probability of a correct prediction.\n\nIf I don’t have ESP, I’m just guessing among 5 options, so \\(p = 1/5 = 0.2\\).\nIf I do have ESP, I should get more than chance, so \\(p &gt; 0.2\\).\n\nIn conventional notation:\n\\[H_0: p = 0.2 \\quad \\text{vs.} \\quad H_a: p &gt; 0.2\\]\n\n\n\n\nWhen we record the number of correct predictions out of 25 attempts, we treat this as a Binomial Random Process. We check the 4 conditions:\n\nBinary outcome: Each prediction was either correct or not.\nFixed number of trials: We made a fixed number of attempts, \\(n = 25\\).\nFixed probability: The probability of a correct guess on each trial doesn’t change (open deck: each card is chosen at random from 5 options each time).\nIndependent trials: We don’t use information from previous attempts to inform the next guess (and the computer randomizes each card independently).\n\nSo the number of correct predictions in 25 attempts can be modeled by a binomial random variable with \\(n = 25\\) and \\(p = 0.2\\) under the null hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\nThe following is an example of how you might write up a Binomial Test in your one-page Project 1 summary. This example uses the ESP question and data from the online test.\n\n\n\nExtra Sensory Perception (ESP) is the ability to accurately predict what will happen using supernatural methods. Do I have it? If so, I could make lots of money by betting on the stock market! To find out, I took an online ESP test and then analyzed the data using the Binomial Test.\nLet \\(p\\) be the probability that I have an accurate prediction. In the online ESP test, there were 5 possible predictions, so if I don’t have ESP, then \\(p = 1/5\\). If I do have ESP, then \\(p &gt; 1/5\\). These hypotheses in conventional notation are:\n\\[H_0: p = 0.2 \\quad \\text{vs.} \\quad H_a: p &gt; 0.2\\]\n\n\n\n\nI recorded the number of correct predictions out of 25 attempts in the online ESP test at Advanced ESP card guessing (Zener Cards) test — PsychicScience.org.\nI believe this data collection satisfied the 4 conditions of a Binomial Random Process:\n\nEach prediction was correct or not (binary outcome).\nI made a fixed number of attempts, \\(n = 25\\) (fixed number of trials).\nMy probability of getting a prediction correct shouldn’t change between attempts (fixed probability of success in a single trial).\nI didn’t use information from my previous attempts to inform my predictions (independent trials).\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive statistics: In 25 attempts, I correctly predicted the shape on 4 cards (16%).\nInferential statistics: Let \\(X\\) be the number of correct predictions in 25 attempts. Assuming I’m just guessing, \\(X\\) is a Binomial random variable with \\(n = 25\\) and \\(p = 0.2\\). I computed the probability of each value of \\(X\\) and the probability of seeing my data (4) or more correct predictions using R. This p-value is 0.76.\n\n\n\n\nThere is a 76% chance of seeing my results of 4 correct predictions or more in another set of 25 attempts if I don’t have ESP and am just guessing. Since this is a large probability, I’ve concluded I don’t have ESP and will find other ways besides betting to make money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe null model is “no ESP” (\\(p = 0.2\\)). Under that model, we compute the probability of data as extreme as what we observed (or more extreme).\nThat probability is the p-value. A small p-value suggests the null model is not consistent with the data; a large p-value (as in this example) suggests the data are consistent with just guessing.\nYour Project 1 report should follow this same structure: Introduction (question, \\(p\\), hypotheses), Data Collection (how you collected data and why the 4 BRP conditions hold), Data Analysis (descriptive and inferential statistics, including p-value), and Conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefine the parameter of interest, \\(p\\): Identify and define \\(p\\). Here \\(p\\) is the theoretical probability of a “success” in a single trial for the population or process (e.g., the probability of a correct guess on one ESP card). \\(p\\) is a parameter of the process, not a value observed in your sample.\nState the null and alternative hypotheses using appropriate symbols:\n\nAlternative hypothesis (\\(H_a\\)): The direction (inequality) of your best guess for the range of values of \\(p\\) — your research question in mathematical form (e.g., \\(p &gt; 0.2\\), \\(p &lt; 0.2\\), or \\(p \\neq 0.2\\)).\nNull hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)): Take the alternative and change the inequality to an equality (e.g., if \\(H_a: p &gt; 0.2\\), then \\(H_0: p = 0.2\\)). This is the baseline or “no effect” assumption.\n\nAssuming the null hypothesis is true, generate the null distribution of \\(x\\) for sample size \\(n\\): Build the probability distribution of the number of successes, \\(x\\), you would expect to see in \\(n\\) trials if \\(H_0\\) were true. This null distribution is used to compute the p-value.\nVerify that the 4 conditions of a Binomial Random Process (BRP) are satisfied by the data collection: Confirm that (a) each trial has a binary outcome (success or failure), (b) the number of trials \\(n\\) is fixed, (c) the probability of success \\(p\\) is fixed on every trial, and (d) trials are independent.\nIdentify the value of \\(x\\) from the dataset: Record the observed number of successes in your \\(n\\) trials (e.g., number of correct ESP guesses out of 25).\nDetermine whether the data are consistent with the null hypothesis by computing the p-value: The p-value is the probability of observing new data (in \\(n\\) trials) that is equal to or more extreme (in the direction of the alternative) than the data you actually observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value suggests the observed data are inconsistent with the null; a large p-value suggests they are consistent.\nMake a conclusion in context: Interpret the p-value and state a conclusion about your research question (e.g., whether there is evidence for ESP or whether the results are consistent with chance).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe R code for the binomial test and plots in this lecture is in this Google Colab notebook:\nLecture 12 — Binomial Test (R code)"

Weekly labs and quizzes are designed to provide regular formative feedback through practice problems, posted solutions, and in-lab support. Midterms require students to demonstrate their understanding of the course material. Projects allow students to apply their knowledge to practical, real-world problems and can be used as part of a portfolio.\nOptionally, students may take a final exam (held during the scheduled final exam period: Wednesday, May 13, 2026, 10:20–12:10 PM, BSS 166) to replace a midterm grade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nWeight\n\n\n\n\nDaily Participation\n5%\n\n\nWeekly quizzes\n30%\n\n\nWeekly labs\n15%\n\n\nTwo midterms\n30%\n\n\nFive projects\n20%\n\n\nTotal\n100%\n\n\n\nFinal letter grades will be assigned based on overall performance according to the following:\nA: 93-100% A-: 90-92% B+: 87-89% B: 83-86% B-: 80-82% C+: 77-79% C: 73-76% C-: 70-72% D: 60-69% F: 0-59%\nNote:\n\nGrade Mode: Letter grade by default. Students may elect Credit/No Credit grading according to university deadlines and procedures.\nA minimum grade of C- is required for the course to count toward GE Area B4.\nIf you stop attending class and stop doing assignments without communicating with me, you will receive a grade of WU (Withdrawal Unsatisfactory). Please communicate with me early if you are having difficulties: it’s possible that I can help you get back on track, or help you obtain a more appropriate grade (W or I) for your situation.\n\n\n\n\nRegular attendance and active participation are expected and essential for success in this course.\n\nAttendance in lecture will be tracked via participation in the warm-up problems.\nAttendance in lab will be tracked via participation in the quizzes.\n\nIf you must miss class, you are responsible for obtaining notes and keeping up with course material.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe policies for late or missed work are as follows:\n\nDaily attendance in lecture is required, but I know that sometimes you will need to miss class due to illness or other emergencies. Each student may miss up to 10 days of lecture without penalty and without contacting me. It’s up to you to reserve these days for emergencies only. In my experience, it is rare for a student to succeed if they regularly miss lecture or are absent for more than two weeks so if you find yourself in this situation, please communicate with me and your advisor so we can help you find a solution to getting back on track.\nWeekly quizzes during Thursday lab sessions are required, but I know that sometimes you will need to miss lab due to illness or other emergencies. If this happens, please contact me to make an arrangement to take the quiz at another time.\nWeekly programming labs are due Tuesdays in Canvas. After the due date, a solution will be posted, so late submissions are generally not accepted except in documented emergencies. These labs will be graded on completion and your reflection.\nProjects are due on the specified date in Canvas. You may submit a late project up to a week late with no penalty. After a week, a project can be turn in for 70% of the grade.\nMidterms are required. If you need to miss a midterm due to illness or other emergencies, please communicate with me as soon as possible to reschedule it. Alternatively, you may take the optional final exam (Wednesday, May 13, 2026, 10:20–12:10 PM, BSS 166) to replace a missed midterm grade.\n\nNote: Technology issues (internet access, device failure, software problems) are not automatically considered valid excuses for late or missed work; students are expected to plan accordingly.\n\n\n\nMuch of your course grade will be based on materials that you produce in-class without having AI as a resource.
