Weekly labs and quizzes are designed to provide regular formative feedback through practice problems, posted solutions, and in-lab support. Midterms require students to demonstrate their understanding of the course material. Projects allow students to apply their knowledge to practical, real-world problems and can be used as part of a portfolio.\nOptionally, students may take a final exam (held during the scheduled final exam period: Wednesday, May 13, 2026, 10:20–12:10 PM, BSS 166) to replace a midterm grade.\n\n\nGrading\n\n\n\nComponent\nWeight\n\n\n\n\nDaily Participation\n5%\n\n\nWeekly quizzes\n30%\n\n\nWeekly labs\n15%\n\n\nTwo midterms\n30%\n\n\nFive projects\n20%\n\n\nTotal\n100%\n\n\n\nFinal letter grades will be assigned based on overall performance according to the following:\nA: 93-100% A-: 90-92% B+: 87-89% B: 83-86% B-: 80-82% C+: 77-79% C: 73-76% C-: 70-72% D: 60-69% F: 0-59%\nNote:\n\nGrade Mode: Letter grade by default.

    "text": "Late or Missed Work Policies\nThe policies for late or missed work are as follows:\n\nDaily attendance in lecture is required, but I know that sometimes you will need to miss class due to illness or other emergencies. Each student may miss up to 10 days of lecture without penalty and without contacting me. It’s up to you to reserve these days for emergencies only. In my experience, it is rare for a student to succeed if they regularly miss lecture or are absent for more than two weeks so if you find yourself in this situation, please communicate with me and your advisor so we can help you find a solution to getting back on track.\nWeekly quizzes during Thursday lab sessions are required, but I know that sometimes you will need to miss lab due to illness or other emergencies. If this happens, please contact me to make an arrangement to take the quiz at another time.\nWeekly programming labs are due Tuesdays in Canvas. After the due date, a solution will be posted, so late submissions are generally not accepted except in documented emergencies. These labs will be graded on completion and your reflection.\nProjects are due on the specified date in Canvas. You may submit a late project up to a week late with no penalty. After a week, a project can be turn in for 70% of the grade.\nMidterms are required. If you need to miss a midterm due to illness or other emergencies, please communicate with me as soon as possible to reschedule it. Alternatively, you may take the optional final exam (Wednesday, May 13, 2026, 10:20–12:10 PM, BSS 166) to replace a missed midterm grade.\n\nNote: Technology issues (internet access, device failure, software problems) are not automatically considered valid excuses for late or missed work; students are expected to plan accordingly.\n\n\nAI Policy\nMuch of your course grade will be based on materials that you produce in-class without having AI as a resource. But you may use AI, such as NotebookLM or ChatGPT, in this course to help you learn the materials or to perform data analyses or on the projects.\nFor work that you do at home that is turned in for a grade I have two requirements:\n\nif you used AI, acknowledge this briefly in the document (you don’t need to state in detail how you used AI or give your prompts, just the name of the AI service you used).\n\nBe responsible for the correctness and appropriateness of all (AI assisted or not) materials you turn in.\n\nI may use AI to assist me in my delivery of the course material, such as asking AI to see if an assignment is appropriate for a college level course or if the wording of a quiz question could be improved. I will not use AI to grade your work or use an AI detection tool to check your work."
