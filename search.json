    "text": "This lab walks you through the planning steps for Project 1. You will state your research question, define \\(p\\) in context, write your null and alternative hypotheses, and create the graph of the binomial distribution you will use in your project. This is a precheck: you don’t need to have collecting data yet; you are just locking in your question, hypotheses, and the updating values of \\(n\\) and \\(p\\) for the R code from Lecture 12 and 13.\nWhat you will turn in: Your research question, a sentence stating what \\(p\\) represents in context, the direction of your best guess for \\(p\\) (your alternative hypothesis), and your graph of the binomial distribution (using your \\(n\\) and \\(p\\)).\n\n\n\nFrom Project 1, you chose a Binomial Random Process you can observe (with \\(n = 25\\) trials). It must satisfy the four BRP conditions, and it must not be a class example (e.g., not coin tosses or ESP).\nYour turn. In one or two sentences, state the research question you are trying to answer with your process.\nMy research question:\n\n\n\n\nThe parameter \\(p\\) is the probability of a “success” on a single trial in your process. For your project, “success” might mean a correct guess, a “yes” response, a left turn, etc. — it depends on your question.\nYour turn. Write one sentence that states what \\(p\\) represents in your context (in words, for a reader who doesn’t know your study).\n\\(p\\) in context:\n\n\n\n\nBefore observing data, you made a best guess about whether \\(p\\) is larger than, smaller than, or not equal to some number. That guess is your alternative hypothesis (\\(H_a\\)). The null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) is the equality that goes with it.\nYour turn. Write your null and alternative hypotheses in conventional notation. Use the same number for \\(p\\) in both (the value under the null).\n\\(H_0\\): \\(p\\) =\n\\(H_a\\): \\(p\\) (choose one: \\(&gt;\\), \\(&lt;\\), \\(\\neq\\))\n\n\n\n\nThe R code in the Lecture 12 / Lecture 13 Colab notebook builds the binomial distribution and plot using \\(n\\) (number of trials) and \\(p\\) (probability of success under the null).\nYour turn. From your process and \\(H_0\\), identify the values you will use in the notebook:\n\n\\(n\\) = (Project 1 uses \\(n = 25\\) trials.)\n\\(p\\) = (Use the number that appears in \\(H_0\\).)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the Lecture 12 — Binomial Test (R code) Colab notebook (same one used in Lectures 12 and 13).\nIn the notebook, find where \\(n\\) and \\(p\\) are set (in the lecture example they are \\(n = 25\\) and \\(p = 0.2\\)).\nChange those to your values of \\(n\\) and \\(p\\) from Step 4.\nRun all the code so that the notebook produces the bar plot of the binomial distribution (the graph of \\(P(X = x)\\) for \\(x = 0, 1, \\ldots, n\\)).\nExport or save that graph so you can turn it in (e.g., screenshot or download from Colab).\n\nYou will use this same graph later in your Project 1 report; for the precheck you only need to submit this graph with your \\(n\\) and \\(p\\).\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the following in a word or google document to Canvas by Midnight on Tuesday, Feb. 24th:\n\nResearch question — The question you wrote in Step 1.\nWhat \\(p\\) represents — The one-sentence description of \\(p\\) in context from Step 2.\nDirection of your best guess (alternative) — Your \\(H_a\\) in words or in notation (e.g., “\\(p &gt; 0.5\\)” or “I think \\(p\\) is greater than 0.5”).\nYour binomial graph — The bar plot of the binomial distribution from Step 5 (using your \\(n\\) and \\(p\\)).\n\nThis precheck confirms your question, parameter, hypotheses, and graph before you add your data and write the full Project 1 report."
